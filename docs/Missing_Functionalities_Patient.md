- Advanced search options for large patient databases.

### 3. Patient Dashboard
- A dedicated dashboard for patients to view their appointments, invoices, and medical history at a glance.

### 4. Multi-Tenant Support
- Ensure that patient data is isolated per clinic (if multi-tenancy is implemented).

### 5. Accessibility and Localization

- Ensure the patient portal is fully optimized for mobile devices.

## Next Steps

### 1. Gap Analysis
- Compare the current implementation with the project requirements in the `Cahier des Charges` to identify additional gaps.

### 2. Prioritization
- Prioritize missing functionalities based on their impact and feasibility.

### 3. Implementation Plan
- Create a roadmap to address the missing functionalities in upcoming sprints.
